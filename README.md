Description

SYNCASYNC is a JavaScript project created to demonstrate the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution. 
It explains how JavaScript handles tasks step by step in synchronous code and how asynchronous code allows non blocking operations using callbacks, promises, and async and await.
This project helps in understanding JavaScript execution flow in a simple and practical way.

Concepts Covered
Synchronous execution in JavaScript
Asynchronous execution and non blocking behavior
Callbacks and event handling
Promises and async and await usage
JavaScript execution order and task handling

Who this is for
This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate learners who want a clear understanding of how JavaScript handles synchronous and asynchronous operations. 
It is especially useful for students preparing for interviews or learning core JavaScript fundamentals.
